    <!--  The order of all filters needs to be define here in the web.xml file. -->

    <!-- Please note that there are no "filter" elements in this web.xml but only "filter-mapping". Filters are defined and enabled
         by annotation @WebFilter in source code. However JEE specification doesn't give the option to manage precedence of filters' invocations in such way.
         That's why xml entries are required.
